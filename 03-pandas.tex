 \frametitle{pandas} 
  
  
 
  While extremely useful, \textit{pandas} is not an essential component of the Python scientific stack unlike NumPy, SciPy or matplotlib, and so while \textit{pandas} doesnâ€™t
 make data analysis possible in Python, it makes it much easier.  \textit{pandas} also provides high-performance,
 robust methods for importing from and exporting to a wide range of formats.
  - example \texttt{read.csv()}
