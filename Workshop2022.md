### Numpy

Stands for numerical Numerical python. 

You Michael pisan fulfills, a lot of important. 

Requirements for the python data science, infrastructure and a good knowledge of numpy will be very important. 

An important aspect of Numerical python is the manipulation and transformation of matrices. 

A lot of the data science, algorithms, and python software packages such as scikit-learn require that all the numerical variables are pre-processed. 
So this is why it's very useful to learn numpy in advance and have some knowledge of numpy in advance. 

Also, for other more scientific applications, such as probability models, which will rely on matrices. Numpy is the package of choice for Working with matrices. 

### Scikit-learn 
Scikit-learn is the python package that is used for machine learning and statistical. Learning the package incorporates, a lot of algorithms and techniques. 
That will be commonly encountered such as random, Forest regression models, decisions are trees and so on clustering analysis, 

### Pandas. 

This is a python package that is used for manipulating and transforming data. 

In the context of data size is very useful to sort of pre-formatted, pre-process your input datasets before applying any algorithms and Palace is a very useful package for doing for this. 

The in the art program is around which the main equivalent of the pandas. Program is the Tidy verse Suite of our packages. 

Cluster analysis. There are two main types of cluster analysis. Two main families of cluster analysis. The first is known as supervised clustering. The second one is known as unsupervised clustering. 

### K-means clustering. 

Is the clustering of. A group of observations into a pre-specified number of clusters based on the numeric attributes. 

Python packages that are used for data visualization. The main one is known as matplotlib. It is very low-level approach to data visualization and requires a lot of detail knowledge. Having said that it allows user to come on come up with some very detailed plots. Another. Python package that used for database. Visualization is Seaborn Seaborn, it takes much more high-level approach. It creates very 

Presentable plots with a minimum of effort. However, 

Ability to create variations is Very restricted. 

An important aspect of how panis is used, is how manages missing data. A key aspect of how it manages. Missing data is imputation missing data imputation. Pandas, will revert to the mean, imputation? As a default setting is known now that this is enough a useful approach.
