\section*{Principal Component Analysis}

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an often-used tool in astronomy and other data-intensive sciences. In a sense, it automates the trial-and-error process discussed in the previous section, and finds the most interesting linear combinations of attributes, so that high-dimensional data can be visualized in a 2D or 3D plot. Scikit-learn has methods to compute PCA and several variants. 

Classic PCA (sklearn.decomposition.PCA) is based on an eigenvalue decomposition of the data covariance, so that for N points, the computational cost grows as $\mathcal{O}[N^3]$. This means that for large datasets like the current one, the fit can be very slow. You can try it as follows, but the computation may take up to several minutes for this dataset:

\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}

>>> from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
>>> pca = PCA(n_components=4)
>>> X = normalize(data['X'])
>>> X_projected = pca.fit_transform(X)  # warning: this takes a long time!
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}


Fortunately, scikit-learn has an alternative method that is much faster. The speed comes at a price: it is based on random projections, so the results are not as robust as the normal method. But for tasks such as ours where we are seeking only a few of a large number of eigenvectors, it performs fairly well. To keep our results consistent between runs, we’ll explicitly set the random seed for the fit. You should repeat this with several different random seeds to convince yourself that the results are consistent:

>>> from sklearn.decomposition import RandomizedPCA
>>> rpca = RandomizedPCA(n_components=4, random_state=0)
>>> X_proj = rpca.fit_transform(X)
>>> X_proj.shape
(4000, 4)

class sklearn.decomposition.PCA(n_components=None, copy=True, whiten=False)
\subsection*{Principal component analysis (PCA)}

Linear dimensionality reduction using \textit{Singular Value Decomposition} of the data and keeping only the most significant singular vectors to project the data to a lower dimensional space.

This implementation uses the \texttt{scipy.linalg} implementation of the singular value decomposition. It only works for dense arrays and is not scalable to large dimensional data.
The time complexity of this implementation is O(n ** 3) assuming n ~ n_samples ~ n_features.

%        ===== %
\subsection*{Parameters:} 
 
\item n\_components : int, None or string
Number of components to keep. if n_components is not set all components are kept:
n_components == min(n_samples, n_features)
if n_components == ‘mle’, Minka’s MLE is used to guess the dimension if $0 < n_components < 1$, select the number of components such that the amount of variance that needs to be explained is greater than the percentage specified by n_components
\item copy : bool
If False, data passed to fit are overwritten and running fit(X).transform(X) will not yield the expected results, use fit_transform(X) instead.
\item whiten : bool, optional
When True (False by default) the components_ vectors are divided by n_samples times singular values to ensure uncorrelated outputs with unit component-wise variances.
 

Whitening will remove some information from the transformed signal (the relative variance scales of the components) but can sometime improve the predictive accuracy of the downstream estimators by making there data respect some hard-wired assumptions.
Attributes: 
`components_` : array, [n_components, n_features]
Components with maximum variance.
`explained_variance_ratio_` : array, [n_components]
Percentage of variance explained by each of the selected components. k is not set then all components are stored and the sum of explained variances is equal to 1.0
`mean_` : array, [n_features]
Per-feature empirical mean, estimated from the training set.
`n_components_` : int
The estimated number of components. Relevant when n_components is set to ‘mle’ or a number between 0 and 1 to select using explained variance.
`noise_variance_` : float
%         === %
The estimated noise covariance following the Probabilistic PCA model from Tipping and Bishop 1999. See “Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning” by C. Bishop, 12.2.1 p. 574 or http://www.miketipping.com/papers/met-mppca.pdf. It is required to computed the estimated data covariance and score samples.
See also ProbabilisticPCA, RandomizedPCA, KernelPCA, SparsePCA, TruncatedSVD
%         ==== %
\subsection*{Notes}
For n_components=’mle’, this class uses the method of Thomas P. Minka: Automatic Choice of Dimensionality for PCA. NIPS 2000: 598-604

Implements the probabilistic PCA model from: M. Tipping and C. Bishop, Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, 61, Part 3, pp. 611-622 via the score and score_samples methods. See http://www.miketipping.com/papers/met-mppca.pdf

%         ==== %
Due to implementation subtleties of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which is used in this implementation, running fit twice on the same matrix can lead to principal components with signs flipped (change in direction). For this reason, it is important to always use the same estimator object to transform data in a consistent fashion.
\subsection*{Examples}
\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}

>>>
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
>>> X = np.array([[-1, -1], [-2, -1], [-3, -2], [1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 2]])
>>> pca = PCA(n_components=2)
>>> pca.fit(X)
PCA(copy=True, n_components=2, whiten=False)
>>> print(pca.explained_variance_ratio_) 
[ 0.99244...  0.00755...]
